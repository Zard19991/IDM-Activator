## üõ†Ô∏è **Installation**
### **Method 1**
1. Download: Obtain the latest version of the tool from the [releases page](https://github.com/oop7/IDM-Activator/releases).
2. Extract: Unzip the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.

### **Method 2**
1. **Open PowerShell**:
   - Right-click the Start menu and select **Windows PowerShell** or **Windows Terminal**.
   - If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click **Yes** to allow PowerShell to run with administrative privileges.

2. Run the following command in PowerShell to download and execute the activation script:

   ```powershell
   irm https://github.com/oop7/IDM-Activator/releases/download/v1.4/v1.4.zip -OutFile v1.4.zip; Expand-Archive v1.4.zip -DestinationPath . -Force; cmd.exe /c .\v1.4\script.bat
   ```
## üíª **Usage**

### 1. Run the Script:
- Double-click on `script.bat` to run. The script will automatically request administrative privileges if needed, so you no longer need to manually select "Run as Administrator."
- If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click Yes to grant the necessary permissions.
- Once elevated, the script will continue running with the appropriate permissions for file operations.

### 2. Follow the On-Screen Instructions:
- Choose an option from the menu:
- `1` to activate Internet Download Manager.
- `2` to activate Extra-FileType_Extensions.
- `3` to exit.
- If you select 1, the script will decode the Base64 encoded files, copy them to the appropriate directory, and provide feedback on the operation status.

## ‚úÖ **Troubleshooting**

- **Administrative Privileges**: If the script does not prompt for administrative rights, ensure you are running it with the required permissions by right-clicking and selecting Run as Administrator.
- **File Paths**: Verify that the encoded.txt , encoded_2.txt , encoded_3.txt and ASCII_art.txt files are correctly placed in the src directory.
- **Warning**: The default installation path for the software is:
``C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Download Manager``
If the software is not installed in this directory, please ensure the path is correct before continuing.
